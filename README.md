Your current project with Triangle Cube Studios is to recreate a 3D version of a 2D image that you have been given by a client.

---------------------------------------------------

My scene consist of cleaning projects. I chose a tub of wipes, paper towels and a sponge. I chose these objects because they are simple and repetitive. The sponge and the counter were made with a cube. The wipes and the paper towels were made from a cylinder. I created a torus for the top of the towels. This kind of strategy can be used in the future projects. You have to work smarter not harder. I was also able to use iteration in my design with the vertex, normal, texture coordinates, and index array. I used the same arrays for the cubes and changed the scaling to create the object I needed. My approach changed several times when creating my objects. Originally, I was going to use a function to draw the cylinder and cubes that accepted different variables, but I decided to change it to a function that draws each object. This project has helped me focus on different aspects like texture and lighting. On this project, I was able to apply a texture to all of my objects. After creating this project, I've learned more about the process of creating 3d objects that can be used in animation and video games. These could be potential career paths.
